            <h3>Real-time Video Messaging Platform</h3>
            <p class="project-description">
                This project is a platform for live video messaging with screen, webcam, and microphone integration.
                The platform allows users to communicate with each other using real-time video, which makes it a perfect tool
                for collaborative work or video-based communication. The project was developed using WebRTC for real-time data transfer
                and Node.js for the server-side logic.

            <p class="project-description">
                The AI Chatbot project focuses on providing automated customer support. It uses natural language processing (NLP)
                to understand customer queries and provide instant responses. The chatbot was developed using Python and the
                NLP library, spaCy, to handle text-based interactions. This project aims to reduce human intervention and improve
                customer service efficiency.
